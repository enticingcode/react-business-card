# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


As part of a collaborative bootCamp called Betterway React Bootcamp, I put together this digital business card using ReactJS following a structured tutorial course. I did have a bit of a headstart on this project as I have followed this Youtube/Scrimba course a bit before, but I went ahead and made a few adjustments here and there to the project
